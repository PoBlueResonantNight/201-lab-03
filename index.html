        <p>Hey my name is Travis Steed, im 27 and im a Navy Vet originally from Indiana. I'm currently a diesel technecian working on MTU diesel engines for Pacific Power Group.</p> 
        <p> My education history started with the Navy outside of high school, learning the basics and fundementals of diesel engines, as well as a variety of other stuff such as firefighting and damage control. Outside of the Navy, I started to go into any trade schools that seemed like fun. I started with Welding which was a 9 month course, then Pipefitting which was 3 months, and then continued on to the schools HVAC tech course which was 8 months. all these courses took place in florida at Tulsa Welding School. After getting into a job, i figured it was time to start another course, so here i am in Computer programming.</p>
        <p>My job experience is very extensive, in high school i was a lifeguard and also worked at a Die casting factory, cleaning the machines out. I didn't want to do that for the rest of my life so i joined the Navy. After my 6 years in the Navy, it was nice to start a civlian job after my schooling and got a job as an apprentice diesel tech for Pacific Power Group</p>
        <p> My goals are to eventually move back to midwest/east coast closer to family and buy a house for a fraction of the prices here in 2 years. I also want to continue to develope my hobbies such as making my craft beer better and further invest into my side jobs. Marriage is a goal but only when the time is right, preferably by the time im 30 but who knows.</p>
